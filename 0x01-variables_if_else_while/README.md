# Create a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
# Create a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
# Create a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
# Create a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
# Create a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line
# Create a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line
